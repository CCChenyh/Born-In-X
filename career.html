					<article>In December 2021, XIN officially launched her SOLO period. The more-than-one-year meticulous preparation of her first full-length album XANADU is the best gift she has given to herself and her followers. In the future, we hope XIN can make more explorations, produce more quality works and contribute more charming performance stages. As UMs, we hope that she can bring her professional ability and valuable qualities to a bigger and broader stage. At the same time, hopefully XIN can complete her wishes as soon as possible - having an own dance room (achieved), having an own recording studio (achieved), having an own concert (in preparation).</article>
